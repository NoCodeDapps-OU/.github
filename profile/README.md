# NoCodeDapps

AI. Bitcoin. NoCode. Launch.

# Vision

Democratize Development.

# Mission

To democratize the development of Bitcoin decentralized applications (dApps) by simplifying the entire process through AI-powered tools and NoCode solutions. We aim to remove the barriers to entry in Web3, empowering developers and non-developers alike to build, deploy, and scale Bitcoin smart contracts and dApps seamlessly, fostering innovation and adoption in the decentralized ecosystem. This allows for nontechnical people to take part in one of the world's greatest inventions, Bitcoin, combined with AI and NoCode. 

# Who, What, When, Where, Why, How

Who

- NoCodeDapps serves developers, non-developers, entrepreneurs, and innovators interested in building dApps on Bitcoin and Bitcoin L2s (also known as Bitcoin Layer 2s) without needing advanced coding skills. The platform has a growing community of NoCodeDevs and NoCodeAdvocates. We've been supported by orgranizations such as Microsoft for Startups and the Stacks Foundation.

What

- NoCodeDapps is the world's first Bitcoin dApp launchpad for Bitcoin and Bitcoin L2s. As an AI-driven platform, NoCodeDapps simplifies the creation, deployment, and scaling of Bitcoin dApps. It offers tools to handle the entire lifecycle of dApp development — frontend, backend, and smart contracts — using a NoCode interface, making it accessible to everyone.

When

- NoCodeDapps is operational today with its v1 platform already live. 

Where

- The platform is globally accessible, serving users worldwide through its online platform. Our team of 4 is global as well. 

Why

- NoCodeDapps exists to democratize access to Bitcoin and Bitcoin L2 development by lowering the barriers to entry. With less than 1% of the world knowing how to code, and Web3 having its own complexities, NoCodeDapps empowers users to build on Bitcoin without technical knowledge, accelerating adoption and innovation in the decentralized space.

How

- By combining AI and NoCode, NoCodeDapps automates much of the dApp development process. Users can input prompts to generate frontend code, use NoCode tools such as Bubble or Airtable for a backend, and deploy Bitcoin smart contracts in a frictionless environment. This end-to-end lifecycle workspace, combined with a user-friendly interface, allows both beginners and seasoned developers to build on Bitcoin swiftly.

# What's Next? 

NoCodeDapps v2+ is coming in Q1 of 2025.
